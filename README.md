# Finite Difference String and Backboard Implementation

## Description

The code and audio files provided are complementary to the paper submitted to the University of Edinburgh in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of BSc Mathematics and Music.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* This program uses python version 3.11.5 and requires NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib to be installed.

### Installing

* In order to run the program, the main file, initial conditions and bridge locations must all be downloaded.
* The program is initally set up to model the sitar as described in the report.
* This program can be modified to reproduce sound of any stringed instrument by changing the basic parameters.

### Executing program

* This program is designed to run on click with no extra user input required.
* This program has two major variables:
  * live_plotting: when True, displays the total energy alongside the live string displacement.
  * save_audio: when True, saves the audio output from the model to the current folder.

### Audio Files

* A selection of audio files generated by the model are contained within the audio files folder, these have been generated with a sample rate of 44.1kHz using the parameters as described in the appendix of the paper.
